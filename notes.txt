Points to remember
1. While inserting if there is exception the application should be ability to go back to its original state.
2. In case of fetching if the fetching of details fails its ok to send the result partially.

Advancements
1. lyrics sync with audio.

Middleware Layer
Middleware is a software layer that sits between your application and the databases. It abstracts the complexity of interacting with multiple databases, providing a unified interface for your application. Here’s how it works and why it’s beneficial:

Abstraction:
Middleware can provide a single API for your application to interact with, regardless of the underlying database. This makes your application code cleaner and easier to maintain.
Separation of Concerns:
By using middleware, you separate the database interaction logic from your business logic. This makes your application more modular and easier to test.
Flexibility:
Middleware can handle different types of databases (e.g., SQL and NoSQL) and manage the connections, queries, and data transformations required for each.
Example
Here’s a simple example of a middleware class in Python that interacts with both PostgreSQL and MongoDB:

Python

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from pymongo import MongoClient

class DatabaseMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, pg_uri, mongo_uri):
        self.pg_engine = create_engine(pg_uri)
        self.mongo_client = MongoClient(mongo_uri)
        self.mongo_db = self.mongo_client['media_db']

    def get_user_details(self, user_id):
        with self.pg_engine.connect() as connection:
            result = connection.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
            user_details = result.fetchone()
        return user_details

    def get_media_files(self, user_id):
        media_files = self.mongo_db.media.find({'user_id': user_id})
        return list(media_files)

Caching
Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area (cache) to reduce latency and improve performance. Here’s how it works and why it’s beneficial:

Performance:
By storing frequently accessed data in memory, you can reduce the time it takes to fetch data from the database.
Reduced Load:
Caching reduces the load on your databases by serving repeated requests from the cache instead of querying the database each time.
Scalability:
Caching helps your application scale better by handling more requests efficiently.
Example
Here’s an example using Redis as a caching layer in a Flask application:

Python

from flask import Flask, jsonify
from redis import Redis
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from pymongo import MongoClient

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_client = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

# PostgreSQL setup
pg_engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname')

# MongoDB setup
mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
mongo_db = mongo_client['media_db']

@app.route('/user/<user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user_details(user_id):
    # Check cache first
    cached_user = redis_client.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if cached_user:
        return jsonify(eval(cached_user))

    # Fetch user details from PostgreSQL
    with pg_engine.connect() as connection:
        result = connection.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
        user_details = result.fetchone()

    # Fetch associated media files from MongoDB
    media_files = mongo_db.media.find({'user_id': user_id})

    user_data = {
        'user_details': dict(user_details),
        'media_files': list(media_files)
    }

    # Store in cache
    redis_client.set(f"user:{user_id}", str(user_data))

    return jsonify(user_data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring and logging are essential for tracking the performance and health of your databases and application. Here’s how they work and why they’re beneficial:

Visibility:
Monitoring provides real-time visibility into the performance and health of your databases and application. This helps you identify and resolve issues quickly.
Diagnostics:
Logging captures detailed information about the application’s behavior, which is useful for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues.
Alerting:
Monitoring tools can send alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded, allowing you to take proactive measures to prevent downtime or performance degradation.
Example
Here’s an example using Prometheus for monitoring and logging in a Flask application:

Python

from flask import Flask, jsonify
from prometheus_flask_exporter import PrometheusMetrics

app = Flask(__name__)
metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)

@app.route('/user/<user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user_details(user_id):
    # Your existing logic to fetch user details
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

================================================================================
Sample Architecute
------------------

1. Have a Master/Manager class for DB management which contains methods to establish connection to different DB, execute query and more.
2. 

=================================================================================
Metadata table 
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    song_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    album_name VARCHAR(255),
    release_date DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    -- Foreign keys to related tables
    artist_id UUID  REFERENCES artists(id),                     -- FK to the songs table
    song_id UUID  REFERENCES songs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,       -- FK to the songs table
    bgm_id UUID  REFERENCES bgm(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,          -- FK to the bgm table
    lyrics_id UUID  REFERENCES lyrics(id) ON DELETE CASCADE      -- FK to the lyrics table


TABLE lyrics 
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    english_lyrics TEXT,
    telugu_lyrics TEXT


TABLE songs
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     song BYTEA,  -- The actual song file or URL reference
     file_format VARCHAR(10)

TABLE bgm
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     bgm BYTEA,  -- BGM file or URL reference
     file_format VARCHAR(10)

TABLE artists
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     artist_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL



-- CREATE INDEX idx_metadata_song_name ON metadata_table(song_name);
-- CREATE INDEX idx_metadata_artist_id ON metadata_table(artist_id);
-- CREATE INDEX idx_metadata_song_id ON metadata_table(song_id);

==========================================================================================



Caching:
For high-traffic applications, consider caching frequently accessed metadata to further optimize response times.





Potential Enhancements
Metadata Synchronization: Ensure there’s good synchronization between the two databases, especially if you’re inserting or updating songs. You may want to implement a mechanism to handle failover or transactional consistency between PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

Microservices Architecture: You could consider splitting your app into microservices, where each service handles a different part of the architecture (e.g., one service for metadata and another for media storage).




Which is More Optimized?
The optimal approach depends on the specific context:

Use a Single Query when:
You need all or most of the data at once (lyrics, song, bgm, etc.).
You want to minimize the number of round-trips between your application and the database.
The data set is moderate in size and can fit into memory without performance degradation.
Use Multiple Queries when:
You don’t always need all the data (e.g., only metadata or lyrics) and can avoid fetching large song/bgm files unless explicitly needed.
Some of the data is very large (e.g., audio files or large text lyrics), and you want to optimize memory usage.
Caching: If you’re caching different pieces of data separately, using separate queries helps minimize the load on the database.
Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)
A possible optimization is a hybrid approach where you:

Fetch the metadata and smaller fields (like song name and lyrics) in a single query.
Fetch large objects (like the song file or bgm) separately, only when required.
For example:






-------------------------------------------------------

kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml

helm install postgres ./charts/postgres -f ./values_override/postgres_values_override.yaml --namespace pluto

helm install flask-app ./charts/flask-app -f ./values_override/flask-app_values_override.yaml --namespace pluto

========================================================

powershell virtualenv
This error occurs because PowerShell’s execution policy is set to restrict script execution. You can change the execution policy to allow scripts to run. Here’s how you can do it:

Open PowerShell as Administrator:
Right-click on the Start menu and select Windows PowerShell (Admin).
Check Current Execution Policy:
Run the following command to see the current execution policy:
Get-ExecutionPolicy

Change the Execution Policy:
To allow local scripts to run, you can set the execution policy to RemoteSigned:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

If you only want to change the policy for the current session, use:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Run Your Script:
Now, try running your activation script again:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
